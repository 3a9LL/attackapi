INTRODUCTION
============
AttackAPI provides simple and intuitive programmable interface for composing
attack vectors with JavaScript and other client and server related
technologies.

PS

AttackAPI is expanding into full featured client, server attack framework.
For that reasons, the 3.x branch was completely redesigned. Any suggestions,
comments and contributions will be greatly appriciated.
